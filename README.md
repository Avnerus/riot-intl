Riot Intl
==============

Basic Riot JS Intergration for FormatJS

Copied from [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/) and modified for riot.
Mixin functionality is not yet merged into master: https://github.com/muut/riotjs/pull/694, so uses an internal mixin function for now.

Tested on both the client and server side, using browserify.
